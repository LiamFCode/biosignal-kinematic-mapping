# Biosignal Kinematics Mapping


## Introduction
   The idea of this project is to research and design a tool that utilizes biosignals picked up by electrodes using EMGs as seen in prosthesis, and EEG-based BCI techniques to clarify motion intent of the movement that is more accurately detected using a variety of sensors of the hand itself. A 3d model is generated of a forearm and hand that mimics the exact motions of the real hand in what I aim to be real time, or under 250ms (human visual reaction time). This model can be used for a number of different things, such as virtual or augmented reality, video games, remote control of things such as drones or wheeled vehicles, control of robotic arms, or interpreted gestures from sign language into text, which can be outputed with text to speech for deaf or non-verbal users. The latter 2 can even be used together to train a pair of robotic hands to translate speech into sign language for presentations.

## Sensor Choice
   It is important to have these, as both EMG and EEG methods are noisy and cannot determine exact angle of motion, as well as having overall low resolution. For these reasons the user's hand must be equipped with an IMU chipset on the back of the hand, as well as flex sensors along the back of the fingers. For these to properly be usable I am designing these onto a glove that can be taylored and calibrated to the user's specifications. Having this assortment of sensors allows for the separation of motion intent and actual motion, so unintentional motion (ie. shakiness) may be eliminated, and inevitable background noise in EMG and EEGs may be removed by no movement in the hand. These must be fine tuned so all motions do not cancel out. The concept of a glove with integrated hardware also allows for other mechanisms, such as force feedback linear actuators at the fingertips, triggered by force sensors at the fingertips of the robotic hand.

## Hand Sensors
   On a rudimentary level the absolute most necessary sensor on this area is the IMU chipset. It is what detects the orientation, speed, tilt, any and all motion. Arduino sells an arduino nano with the integrated IMU unit, which is also convenient since the back of the hand is the best place for the microcontroller to be housed. The next most important measurement is the fingers, which can be measured with flex sensors. While they require more calibration due to their non linearity, they allow for a more dexterous, and much less bulky, finger design. To properly measure the output of the resistor, the wiring must be 5 volts in, and the out is wired to a junction where one wire goes to a pin on the arduino nano, and the other goes to a fixed resistor at somewhere between 10K and 100K which then leads to ground. This allows the arduino to use the fixed resistor as a reference point, and once the sensor is mapped to the proper extent the resistance can be adjusted to what produces the best resolution. It is vital that these sensors stay stationary so they must be adhered or sewn into the glove.

   ### Initial Hand Design

The most common causes of output drift in an IMU chipset are to the gyroscope, and are caused by heat and angular random walk (ARW) caused by high frequency noice. The first one can simply be solved by placing a small fan and/or heatsink, or alternatively heat shielding around the arduino. ARW can be negated by the fusion of sensors, so if gyroscope changes without change in magnetometer (or vice versa) the input may be voided. This does cause issues, such as if a magnet throws off the magnetometer then the hand is rendered useless. The flex sensors may shift from their initial mapping slowly over time, but this can be fixed with a simple calibration. Methods to test the accuracy may be installed, but recalibration is both more simple, and a better habit to have in place. Every sensor is susceptible to drift, but pairing sensors to create redundancies also allows for correction of any issue of this extent. Another benefit of having a greater number of contrasting sensors is it allows detection of a larger variety of things that can be implemented into the calculations.
